# CS-220-Personal-Project

My project will be based on a banking system that can allow their user to quickly set up a bank account online.

*The core classes for the banking system will include the User Login, Personal Information, and Money Transfer, which handles the usersâ€™ withdrawals, deposits, and money transfers.  Each user must be at least 18 and over in order to create their own personal account, and each person will be assigned by their own 8-digit account number by which I, the software overseer, can search each user by that number.

*The User Login class will contain the user name, password, and security questions with the extended class Personal Information and any personal information such as home address and telephone number.  

*Money Transfer will contain lists that will record past transactions and money transfers created.  This is where the checking and savings account will be set up.  It will also account for the number of times money transfers and savings account withdrawals will occur within a certain timeframe with a timer included to keep track of that timeframe.  The maximum number of times is always three per month before being fined for every transaction.  After that month, the count resets.  What I will expect is for the timeframe to be equivalent to a month so that the count reverts back to 0 once that timeframe is complete.
